- compare message / code size (if even available) / deserialization time of:
  - protobuf (using nanopb, probably)
  - msgpack
  - flatbuffers
  - capnproto
  - the json library will uses
  - ROS? (only if it seems clear how to just use their serialization /
    deserialization stuff, without commiting too much else to the ecosystem,
    particularly on the uC code size front...)
  - python struct? maybe defeats the purpose...
  - are there any libraries that support small types like python struct can?
