- compare message / code size (if even available) / deserialization time of:
  - protobuf (using nanopb, probably)
  - msgpack
  - flatbuffers
  - capnproto
  - the json library will uses
  - ROS? (only if it seems clear how to just use their serialization /
    deserialization stuff, without commiting too much else to the ecosystem,
    particularly on the uC code size front...)
  - python struct? maybe defeats the purpose...
  - are there any libraries that support small types like python struct can?

- write scripts that can be used with another arduino / DAQ board to verify that
  parts of this are working, such as:
  - arduino script that detects which pins are high (connect pins 1:1) and
    reports
  - script that interprets DAQ signals to measure timing and check
  
- add something to do all install steps on clone?
  + do i need to also clone that submodule? probably, right?

- test behavior of PinSeqeunce.pins max_size specified in olf.options is as
  expected 

- maybe i should test my C code on my host computer before trying to test it on
  the arduino?

- (if using nanopb-arduino) is it a problem that pb_istream_s bytes_left is
  defined as SIZE_MAX? no way to actually have it defined using Streams?
  appropriate test case?
